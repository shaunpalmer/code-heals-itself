"""
ðŸ”¥ EXTREME DIFFICULTY TEST - Multiple Subtle Bugs
=================================================

This test intentionally combines:
1. Visual confusion (0 vs O in class name)
2. Indentation errors in nested loops
3. Missing syntax (colon)
4. Logic error (off-by-one in loop range)
5. Semantic error (wrong attribute name)
6. Type confusion (string vs int)

These bugs require REASONING, not just pattern matching.
The LLM needs to understand:
- What the code is TRYING to do
- Why it's semantically wrong
- How pieces interact

Expected: 2-4 attempts to get everything right
