First, I’ll re-orient on the written algorithm notes and code to answer your “what do you think of it” question with a concise readout. Then I’ll scan the Python side for any obvious smells or rough edges, jot down integration/polish upgrades we could do for broader platform adoption, and finally inventory the current endpoints/extensibility hooks so we know what’s already wired.

algorithm readout
The “time-travel” envelope design really is the backbone: every attempt enriches the same JSON artifact with attempts, breaker state, counters, trend metadata, hashes, etc., so each subsystem (risk gates, sandbox, LLMs) consumes the full history. It’s deliberate and keeps state consistent while the breaker and trend logic make informed decisions.
Observability is baked in: counters, timeline entries, hashes, trend metadata, and resource usage all flow through helpers. This makes analytical features (e.g., improvement velocity, risk flags) meaningful because they’re rooted in the same envelope.
The multi-stage gating strategy (risk policy, dual breaker, cascading chain, watchdog) ensures the algorithm doesn’t blindly retry; decisions like PROMOTE, RETRY, ROLLBACK, or HUMAN_REVIEW come from synthesized evidence. That’s a thoughtful balance between autonomy and safety.
python code smells snapshot
Metadata merge inline in AIDebugger.process_error: the comment you dropped (“if you merge the entire envelope you won’t have an Error delta”) is a reminder we should probably wrap that in a method that protects critical fields (e.g., merge_metadata already does it, but a docstring or guard for keys like patch_data might prevent misuse).
mutable_payload() copying overhead: we deepcopy the entire envelope on every helper interaction; the context manager makes this manageable, but we should make sure we don’t accidentally call it in tight loops (profiling might show this as a hotspot).
datetime.utcnow() warnings in helpers: tests already emit a deprecation warning; we should flip to timezone-aware datetime.now(datetime.UTC) to stay future-proof.
helper_mark_success vs. PatchEnvelope.mark_success naming: minor, but the Python side still uses helper aliases like helper_mark_success; aligning naming with the encapsulated methods would reduce confusion.
No blockers, but these are areas where we could refactor for clarity or performance.
polish ideas for broader integrations
Documented public contract: create a mini README for PatchEnvelope describing the helper usage, mutable context manager, and JSON shape. Platform adapters will want a stable schema reference alongside schemas/patch-envelope.schema.json.
Adapter shims: consider TypeScript/Python “bridge” classes that serialize envelopes for HTTP/gRPC so external systems can subscribe to attempt timelines without importing repo internals.
Plugin registration: the observer system is a strength; adding a small registry (e.g., register_observer("my-platform", ObserverClass)) would let integrators drop in platform-specific observers without editing ai-debugging.
CLI harness: a simple CLI or FastAPI wrapper exposing process_error would let other teams call the engine via HTTP; it’d double as a reference implementation for the endpoints you mentioned.
Telemetry exporters: optional hooks to push envelope snapshots to Prometheus or OpenTelemetry would help downstream monitoring systems rely on the signals we already emit.
endpoints & extensions we currently have
TypeScript AIDebugger TODO block (top of ai-debugging.ts) outlines planned REST endpoints (POST /api/debug/run, GET /api/envelopes/:id, etc.), but they’re not implemented yet—just a roadmap.
Extensions directory (src/extensions/...): includes Zod validation, ESLint runner, Stylelint reporter—these are pluggable classes that showcase how to extend functionality.
Observers: there’s a pattern for watchers (HangWatchdog, RiskyEditObserver, PathResolutionObserver, FinalPolishObserver), which integrators can hook into by instantiating or replacing in the constructor options.
Memory adapters: both Python and TypeScript have buffer classes that can persist results; these act like extension points for storage backends.
We don’t yet expose actual HTTP endpoints, but the scaffolding (interfaces, helper exports, comment TODOs) indicates where they would live. If we want real plug-and-play, standing up a minimal API layer would be the next step.
Happy to dive deeper on any of these strands or start implementing the polish items if you want to prioritize them.
