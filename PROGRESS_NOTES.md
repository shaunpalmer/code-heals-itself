# Progress Notes — October 10, 2025

## Current Status
- ✅ `demo_full_healing_cycle.py` still runs end-to-end (LLM fix → validation → DB update).
- ✅ LM Studio endpoint confirmed alive at `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1` (model list returned).
- ✅ Minimal LLM probe works; simple "hello" interactions succeed.
- ❌ `run_multi_attempt_test.py` continues to exhaust all 6 attempts without progress (returns empty `error` field from client).

## Next Up
1. Add richer logging around the multi-attempt runner to capture the underlying HTTP exception (why `response['error']` is empty).
2. Consider increasing attempts or simplifying prompt pieces once errors are visible.
3. Re-run `run_multi_attempt_test.py` after logging fix to check if convergence happens.

## Context
- Baseline functionality is solid; the issue is isolated to the advanced multi-step healing harness.
- No code changes have been made to the main algorithm during this session.
